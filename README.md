# Alumni website

Our website is targeted towards university alumni from the Bernice university to inform them about upcoming events and professional development opportunities. The website consists of a landing page which is the default page displayed when you visit the website, an events page which links to our google calendar, about section to display information about members of our team and finally a contact section with a form for people to reserve slots for events they want to participate in.

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
